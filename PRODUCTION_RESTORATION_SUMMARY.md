**Date:** July 1, 2025  
**Client:** David Giunta  
**Site:** https://investors.davidgiunta.com  
**Instance:** EC2 i-022c9cde43c05ef1e  

## Initial Problem
- Production site was completely down
- EC2 instance was stopped (likely due to billing/maintenance)
- SSL certificates had expired
- No SSH access (missing key pair)

## Work Performed

### 1. Instance Recovery
- Started stopped EC2 instance from AWS Console
- Diagnosed SSH access issue (missing "Investor Portal (Black Plum)" key)
- Used EC2 Instance Connect for browser-based access
- Added new SSH key for future access

### 2. Docker Container Diagnosis & Repair
- Found Docker containers in mixed state:
  - Database (PostgreSQL): Running ✓
  - Web app (Next.js): Running ✓
  - Nginx: Crashed (8 months ago) ✗
  - Certbot: Running but failing ✗

### 3. Fixed Port Conflicts
- Discovered system nginx running on host blocking Docker nginx
- Killed system nginx process
- Successfully restarted Docker nginx container

### 4. SSL Certificate Renewal
- Certificates expired December 10, 2024
- Fixed certbot webroot permissions
- Manually renewed SSL certificates (valid until September 29, 2025)
- Verified HTTPS access restored

### 5. Full System Restoration
- All Docker containers now running properly
- Site accessible at https://investors.davidgiunta.com
- SSL certificates valid and auto-renewal configured
- Database and application data intact

## Technical Details

**Root Causes:**
1. EC2 instance stopped (billing/AWS limits)
2. System nginx conflicting with Docker nginx
3. SSL certificates expired during downtime
4. Certbot auto-renewal failing due to nginx being down

**Time Spent:** ~1.5 hours

**Current Status:** ✅ Fully Operational

## Recommendations
1. Set up monitoring/alerting for downtime
2. Configure AWS billing alerts
3. Generate new SSH key pair (current one was exposed)
4. Consider backup/disaster recovery plan
5. Set up SSL certificate expiry alerts
